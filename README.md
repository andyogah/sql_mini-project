Springboard Data Wrangling SQL Mini-Project

This exercise is part of the requirements of the Springboard Data Science Career Track program. As one of the curated tutorials and exercises at Mode Analytics website, it is meant to not only demonstrate critical analytical thinking ability using SQL syntax but also allows one understand the meaning behind a proffered solution. All case studies on that website were from suggestions and interviews with Analytics managers.  

Although the requirement of the Springboard program is to complete at least one of the cases, I will try to do more as time permits. The case study in question is investigating a drop in user engagement on the Yammer platform using SQL syntax and data visualization. The result of the analysis shows users in the US had the most significant decline in usage, which happened after Yammer stopped sending out reengagement emails. It is advisable for readers to skip over to the cases, read an overview of Yammer as a company, and how Yammer analysts work to better understand the context of my solution to the issue.

By following my thought process, anyone should be able to replicate the same analysis, and possibly get a good head start in the right direction if need be. All SQL codes that generated the plots in this analysis are on my Mode Analytics profile.
